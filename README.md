# A minimal model of self-organized clusters with phase transitions in ecological communities

This repository contains the Mathematica files for the paper "A minimal model of self-organized clusters with phase transitions in ecological communities" by S. Y. Li, M. Kardar, Z. Feng, and W. Taylor. The files include:

- `clusters.nb`: The notebook with code for simulating the Lotka-Volterra model of self-organized clusters, as well as code for generating the figures.

- `data/`: The folder containing computational data used in Figure 8 (number of stable fixed points).
